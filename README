There are five sample wav file which are authenticated on server.
There are three test file which are to be tested from the server database.
I use correlation to do that.
Also there are six figure one of test file and others of sample signals plot.
You need to load these packages before running the octave or matlab
>pkg load control
>pkg load signal
these can be downloaded on opensuse by following command
> sudo zypper in octave-forge-signal
